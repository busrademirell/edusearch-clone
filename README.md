# Modern Search Homepage Clone

## 🎯 Purpose

This project was developed to recreate the design and layout of a modern 2019 search engine homepage, inspired by classic minimalist web interfaces. The reference design is taken from a [Wayback Machine archived page](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759/https://www.google.com/) to study early modern web aesthetics. The main goal is to practice responsive design, understand layout structures, and strengthen HTML & CSS fundamentals.
